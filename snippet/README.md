# Snippet

Snippet is a marked portion of a text file, which is can be tagged, named and
addressed by name.

Snippets are useful in the context of my workflow, which I am going to explain here.

Every task or projects starts with an appropriately named folder with a single
file `notes.txt` in it. This file starts as initial and most basic information
about project or task. This may include date when I started it, initial communication, short
description on what needs to be done, links to relevant files and repos, etc. As project
progresses, this folder accumulates various files, related to it, such as
sample outputs, screenshots, error logs, documents forwarded by other people,
etc. I try to keep notes on each file (where it came from and what is it for)
in the `notes.txt` file and also try to maintain some sort of journal with
timestamped entries which described events of this project.
I keep links to (and possibly notes about) repos, branches and tickets in this
file too.
